Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release updates the profile version to *5*. Please use the upgrade feature
in Plone's ``control panel`` or in  ``portal_setup`` in the ZMI to upgrade the
``collective.xmpp.chat:default`` profile to this version.

This release now uses vCards. If your users don't have XMPP vcards, you won't see
their profile pictures and full names anymore.

collective.xmpp.core >= 0.3 provides a way to bulk add/update vCards for all the
users in your site. In Plone's control panel, go to ``XMPP Integration``, then
``User Registration`` and then click ``Update ALL Users' vCards``.

**NB:** *This version depends on plone.app.jquery >= 1.7.2. Plone sites older than
version 4.3 might experience minor incompatibility errors with any jquery
version higher than 1.4.*

- Uses the newest version of converse.js (0.5), which includes many changes.
- Better caching via backbone.localStorage.
- More detailed configuration of chatrooms.
- vCard support.
- Multilingual support for converse.js, with translations in af, de, it, es and pt_BR.
- Reconnnect automatically if the connection drops.
- Remember custom status messages upon page reload.
- Improve message counter to only increment with the window is not focused.
- Remove dependencies on JQueryUI and Burry.js
